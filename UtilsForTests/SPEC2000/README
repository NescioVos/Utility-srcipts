This utilits are for estimating  time and memory usage while running building with LTO.
This is for running tests separately by hands.

1. To use this scripts, move them to benchspec/CINT2000 or benchspec/CFP2000 in the installed SPEC2000 benchmark directory.
2. Compile all tests by clang with "-c -flto" flags.
   To use with lazy loading LTO add "-mllvm -enable-func-descriptors"
3. Create script "build_as_spec" in <test_name>/src dir.
4. Run test_all or test_mem to estimate run time or memory usage correspondingly.
5. Enjoy
